# üöÄ Vercel Deployment Guide - Link Extraction Fix

## ‚ö° Quick Fixes Applied

### 1. **Timeout Handling**
- Added 15-second timeout for OpenAI API calls
- Prevents Vercel function timeouts that break link extraction

### 2. **Fallback-First Approach**
- Now runs regex-based extraction FIRST
- AI enhancement is attempted as secondary improvement
- Ensures links are always extracted even if AI fails

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Better environment variable checking
- Graceful degradation when API keys are missing
- More robust URL pattern matching

### 4. **Vercel Configuration**
- Extended function timeouts in `vercel.json`
- Increased response limits in `next.config.js`

## üîß Required Environment Variables in Vercel

### **Critical for Link Extraction:**
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### **Optional but Recommended:**
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
LINKEDIN_RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key_here
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
```

## üéØ How to Set Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. Add each variable with these exact names
5. Deploy the project

## üìã Testing Checklist

### **Before Deployment:**
- [ ] All environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] OpenAI API key has sufficient credits
- [ ] Test locally with `npm run dev`

### **After Deployment:**
- [ ] Upload a resume with GitHub/LinkedIn links
- [ ] Check if links appear in the final results
- [ ] Verify clicking links opens correct profiles
- [ ] Test with different resume formats (PDF, DOCX)

## üîç Debugging Link Extraction

### **Check Vercel Function Logs:**
1. Go to Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Functions tab
2. Click on the failing function
3. Check logs for these messages:
   - `"=== STARTING ROBUST LINK EXTRACTION ==="`
   - `"Fallback extraction result:"`
   - `"AI enhanced [platform]:"`

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| No links found | Missing OpenAI key | Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to Vercel |
| Links work locally, not in Vercel | Timeout issues | Check function timeout in logs |
| Partial links extracted | Regex pattern mismatch | Enhanced patterns now included |
| Empty analysis results | Response size limit | Increased limits in `next.config.js` |

## ‚úÖ Expected Behavior

### **Successful Link Extraction:**
```json
{
  "github": "https://github.com/username",
  "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/profile",
  "portfolio": "https://portfolio-site.com",
  "website": "https://website.com"
}
```

### **In the UI:**
- Links should be clickable and properly formatted
- Icons should appear next to each link type
- Links should open in new tabs

## üö® If Links Still Don't Work

1. **Check Function Logs** in Vercel dashboard
2. **Verify Environment Variables** are correctly set
3. **Test Different Resume Formats** (some PDFs may parse differently)
4. **Check API Quotas** (OpenAI, etc.)

## üéâ Success Indicators

- ‚úÖ Links appear in the EnhancedResultsStep component
- ‚úÖ Links are clickable and functional
- ‚úÖ No timeout errors in Vercel logs
- ‚úÖ Fallback extraction works when AI fails
- ‚úÖ Performance is acceptable (< 30 seconds total analysis)

---

**The link extraction is now much more robust and should work reliably in both local development and Vercel production environments.**
